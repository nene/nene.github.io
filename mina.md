Hi, I'm **Rene Saarsoo** ðŸ‘‹

I'm the autor of several somewhat-popular open source libraries:
[SQL Formatter][], [Lebab][], [JSDuck][].

Currently I'm mainly working on an [SQL Parser CST][] library that produces a Concrete Syntax Tree
(rather than the usual Abstract one).

There seems to be a bit of a theme with these libraries:
they all revolve around static analysis of source code.
I guess that's my passion.

ðŸš² My other passion is riding stupid-long distances on a road bike.
I guess that's also a theme - I like doing hard stuff.
